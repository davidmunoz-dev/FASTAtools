# FASTAtools

FASTA is a file format often used in bioinformatics. It consists in matching identifiers and DNA sequencies.

The identifier is declared on a line starting with the > symbol. The following filled lines, which do not start with >, contain the DNA sequence.

Read a FASTA file from the standard input, and write the DNA sequences to the standard output, while complying with the FASTA format
